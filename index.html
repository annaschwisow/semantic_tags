        <h2> Grandma Bev </h2>
            <article>
                <p> My grandma Bev is in her early '80s, but if you met her you would <strong> never </strong> guess.  She is an amazing cook, maintains a garden and small orchard, rides her road bike alomost every day, gets together with her friends, takes picnics to the beach, and spends a ton of time on Facebook.

                        <h4> Road Biking </h4>
                        <p> Grandma Bev and her husband, Stan, both have road bikes that they bought when I was in grade school in the '90s. It was a big deal at the time because their old bikes were stolen out of the back of their pickup truck while we were on a family vacation.  She is still riding the same bike.  Grandpa Stan is also in good enough shape to ride his bike with her, but I've never seen them ride together.  I rode his bike with her one day, and the bikes are pretty rickety compared to my more modern road bike. I think that makes her biking all the more impressive, because  the condition of the brakes alone are enough to make me nervous on their bikes, but she doesn't seem to mind.

                        <h4> Facebooking and Internet Stalking </h4>
                        <p> Grandma also has a Facebook account.  All of her friends are on Facebook and quite a bit of her family. She credits me for setting up her account, but it wasn't me because I don't like Facebook, and my account is currently deactivated. I did help her put a picture though because I hate it when people don't have a profile picture. </p>
                        <p> She is really good at Facebook. When I first met my boyfriend, I showed her a picture of him but didn't tell her his name. She looked through my Facebook friends and found him, and then googled his name and sent my parents an email with links to his blogs and articles about him.  I didn't even know he had a blog at that point. I don't like googling people. I'd rather know them in person. </p>

        <h2> Grandma Wilma </h2>
            <article>
                <p> My grandma Wilma is pretty cool when she can relax. She had a relatively rough life, starting with growing up on a farm in Kansas during the dust bowl and depression.

                        <h4> Photo Albums</h4>
                        <p> Grandma likes curating photo albums and scrap books of family members, including me and my cousins. They are not pretty scrap books like in craft stores, but they have literally every news article ever in them, including several photocopies of each artile. I'm not sure why she's so into photocopying, but she is. They also have photos, and mine includes some particlarly embarassing ones that she likes to show to my friends and whoever I'm dating. </p>

                        <h4> Dog "Gracie" </h4>
                        <p> My grandma also has an obnoxious teacup poodle named "Gracie" that she got right after my grandpa passed away. Gracie really adores my grandma, and although grandma hasn't really made an effort to train her, she listens to everything grandma says.  She has a really shrill bark, which is good because grandma can't really hear anything else when she doesn't have her hearing aids in. </p>

                        <h4> Weird things grandma collects</h4>
                            <p> Grandma collects a lot of weird stuff as a result of having grown up in the depression.  She <strong> never </strong> throws anything away. Here is an incomplete list of things she collects: </p>
